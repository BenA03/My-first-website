# My First Website

With a few lessons of XHTML/CSS under my belt as part of my digital humanities class, it was time to try writing a site of my own. I have been playing a lot of chess as of lately, and decided it would be fun to create a site that showcased the basics of my favorite openings.
In the future, I would love to add site interaction, where the users can move the pieces on the board images and learn the openings themselves.
