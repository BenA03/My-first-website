# My First Website

My first try writing a website with XHTML/CSS. I have been playing a lot of chess as of lately, and decided it would be fun to create a site that showcased the basics of my favorite openings.
In the future, I would love to add site interaction, where the users can move the pieces on the board images and learn the openings themselves.
