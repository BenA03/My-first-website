            <h1>My Favorite Chess Openings</h1>
            <h2>What are chess openings?</h2>
            <p>Chess is a huge game, containing nearly limitless games and move orders.
                Mathmeticians calculate that just within the first 5 moves from each player, there
                are <strong>69,352,859,712,417</strong> possible games that could have occured.</p>
            <p>Of course, not all of these games place white and black on equal footing. Instead,
                chess players often play certain lines of moves at the beggining of a game, called
                an <em>opening</em>, that give their side a chance to best attack, defend, or
                outmaneuver their opponent.</p>
            <p>Each opening has different styles, short-term, and long-term strategies. In this
                website, I'll be explaining some of my favorite openings and some of the strategic
                ideas behind each one.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>The Nimzo-Larsen Attack</h2>
            <p>When I am playing with the white pieces, one of my favorite openings is <a
                    href="https://www.chess.com/openings/Nimzowitsch-Larsen-Attack" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">The Nimzo-Larsen Attack</a>. It begins with the move
                pawn to b3. The idea of this opening is to develop the bishop on the long diagonal
                (which is often refered to as a Fianchetto), placing pressure on black's e pawn if
                it is moved to the center, and, over time, targeting the black king if it castles
                kingside.</p>

            <p><em>According to lichess, a popular online chess site, I win about 49.2% of my
                    Nimzo-Larsen games, draw 7.9% of the time, and lose 42.9% of the time.</em></p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>The London System</h2>
            <p>Another opening I play very often with white is called the <a
                    href="https://www.chess.com/openings/London-System" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">London System</a>. It begins with the move pawn to d4
                and bishop to f4. It is relatively easy opening and good for beginners to learn. The
                plans of the opening is to push your pawns to c3 and e3, play your other bishop to
                d3, and your knights to d2 and f3. You can use your strong bishops to create an
                attack on the enemy king when the time is right. If you are looking to get into
                chess for the first time, this might be a good opening for you!</p>
            <img src="London.png" alt="The London featured on a board" />
            <p><em>According to lichess, a popular online chess site, I win about 54.5% of my London
                    System games, draw 3.9% of the time, and lose 41.6% of the time.</em></p>

        <section>
            <h2>The Caro-Kann</h2>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.chess.com/openings/Caro-Kann-Defense" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Caro-Kann</a> is an opening played by black that can
                be used after white has started the game by playing pawn to e4. The Caro-Kann begins
                with the move pawn to c6 and then pawn to d5, which tries to attack white's pawn on
                e4. White can choose to protect the pawn, push it forwards, or take our pawn. All
                three of these options lead to different and exciting kinds of games!</p>
            <img src="Caro.png" alt="The Caro-Kann featured on a board" />
            <p><em>According to lichess, a popular online chess site, I win about 71.4% of my
                    Caro-Kann, never draw, and lose 28.6% of the time.</em></p>
